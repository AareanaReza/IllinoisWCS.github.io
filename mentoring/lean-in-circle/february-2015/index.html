					<h2>Pitching Yourself</h2>
					<ul>
                        <li>Do: Firm handshake, eye contact</li>
                        <li>Do: Have your resume in view, but start with a normal conversation</li>
                        <li>Do: Ask about certain teams after having done your research</li>
                        <li>Don't: Go up to a company and ask what they do, or ask if they have developer positions available</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
                
                <section>
                    <h2>Let's Practice!</h2>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Pair up with the person next to you: take turns pitching yourself to one another, as if you were at a career fair</li>
                    <h3>Example</h3>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Hi, nice to meet you, I’m Emily. I am currently a sophomore studying Computer Science. Last summer, I had an internship at kCura and I primarily worked on a web application that processed XML data for US patents to be used in a web application. This internship sparked an interest in web development. The positions you have would be a good fit for someone with my skills and interests. Could you tell me a little bit more about the positions you have in the Front-end teams at <i>Company Name Here</i>? I’m particularly interested in <i>Specific Company Teams/Divisions Here</i>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What would you say are your weaknesses?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why would you say that is your weakness?</li>
                        <li>How are you improving on that weakness?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Don't say the cliche - "I'm a perfectionist. I work too hard. I'm lazy." - everyone says this, doesn't reveal anything about yourself.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                
                <section>
                    <h2>Example</h2>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>My weakness is public speaking. I really want to improve this skill for future project and group presentations. I recently had a presentation due for a Communications class and I practiced my speech in front of the mirror to watch out for “ums” and “likes”.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Why this works</h3>
                   	<ul>
                   		<li>Shows the recruiter that you have recognized a sufficient weakness and that you are actively trying to improve upon it.</li>
                   	</ul>
                </section>
                
                <section>
					<h2>What would you say are your strengths?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Give examples as to why you consider this your strength.</li>
						<li>Why do you think this strength will convince me to hire you?</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Tips</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>If you don’t know your strengths, get a second opinion. Ask other people what they think your strengths are and why.</li>
						<li>If you need a third opinion, reviewing your resume can help you.</li>
						<li>Back up your strengths with stories - this helps portray confidence rather than arrogance.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Example</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Scenario: Front-end developer position interview</li>
						<li>“I think my greatest strength is attention to detail. Through various projects, I have developed a user interfaces for websites and learning responsive design has really heightened my awareness of maximizing usability on various screen sizes and paying attention to changes in styling. I am meticulous and follow through with my designs.”</li>
					</ul>
                    <h3>Why this works</h3>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Shows the recruiter why they should hire you, in particular, if your strength matches the strengths they look for in the position you’re interviewing for.</li>
                    	<li>Shows the recruiter why you’re a good fit.</li>
                    	<li>Try to match your greatest strength to what the company has put as desired skills in the job posting.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section>
                    <h2>How have you handled a difficult working relationship with a teammate for a project or other related event?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What was the challenge you faced?</li>
                        <li>What actions did you take the resolve this?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Give context to the project/situation. What was the project? How big was your team? What was the task breakdown?</li>
                    	<li>Many company cultures value teamwork, so showing that you have this experience will show the recruiter that you can work on their teams.</li>
                    	<li>Don’t bash the teammate. Instead, explain what the challenge was and then what steps you took to resolve it.</li>
                    	<li>Emphasize what you learned from that experience.</li>
                    	<li>STAR - Situation Task Action Result</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                
                <section>
                    <h2>Example</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>“Last semester, for a final class project, 3 other students and I worked on a web app for helping students find distinct restaurants. But one of our teammates often didn’t share what he was coding. We often felt lost and that we couldn’t contribute as much. So at one of our meetings, we sat down and had a feedback session...After this session, we started implementing pair-programming so that everyone felt that their contribution was more equal.”</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Why This Works</h3>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Shows that you have teamwork experience</li>
                    	<li>Show that you can easily integrate with already established teams at the company</li>

                		<li>What were some of the lessons you learned during this project period?</li>
                	</ul>
                	<h3>Tips</h3>

                	<ul>
                		<li>A project that I have worked on in the past is the website for a startup called Miss Possible. I first developed their landing page using Bootstrap, HTML/CSS and some Javascript. Then I implemented some backend features, allowing the startup to collect emails for their newsletter. One of the biggest challenges for me was collaborating with graphic designers on assets for the site...</li>
